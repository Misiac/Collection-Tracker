## Description
Collection Tracker is a JavaFX application designed for hobbyists and collectors who want to organize and manage their personal collections efficiently. Whether you collect stamps, coins, action figures, or anything else, this app aims to simplify the process of keeping track of your items, their details, and the overall status of your collection.

<strong> Collection Tracker is not intended for commercial use purposes. This is my first project in JavaFX, and it was made to get to know the framework and for fun.
 I'll be using it though! </strong>

## Key Features

* Collection creation - create your own collection with background, name as you please
  - Choose image file, and it'll automatically generate a collection file in the chosen path.
 * Item adding - select a file, name and number
* Edit item possession status
  - If you have the item, just click the checkbox!
*  Switch between collections
	  - Load more collections and switch as you'd like.
